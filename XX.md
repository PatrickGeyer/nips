NIP-XX
======

Accommodation
-------------

`draft` `optional` `author:PatrickGeyer` 

The purpose of this NIP is to allow nostr users to discover accommodation availability similarly to AirBnB, booking.com or longer-term accommodation finding services.

## Terms

- `guest` - NOSTR user that is searching for accommodation
- `host` - NOSTR user that is providing accommodation
- `listing` - item of accommodation

## Nostr Marketplace Clients

### Hoster admin

Where the `host` creates, updates and deletes listings, as well as where they manage bookings, payments and communication with `guests`.

The `host` admin software can be purely clientside, but for `convenience` and uptime, implementations will likely have a server client listening for NOSTR events.

### Marketplace

`Marketplace` software should be entirely clientside, either as a stand-alone app, or as a purely frontend webpage. A `host` subscribes to listing events tagged with specific area and availability date range. These become listed and searchable. The marketplace client is like any other booking site, with date selector, pricing and eventual checkout. 

## `Hoster` publishing/updating listings (event)

A hoster can publish these events:

## Checkout events

All checkout events are sent as JSON strings using ([NIP04](https://github.com/nostr-protocol/nips/blob/master/04.md)).

The `host` and the `guest` can exchange JSON messages that represent different actions. Each `JSON` message `MUST` have a `type` field indicating the what the JSON represents. Possible types:

| Message Type | Sent By  | Description         |
|--------------|----------|---------------------|
| 0            | Guest    | New Booking         |

| 2            | Hoster   | Order Status Update |
